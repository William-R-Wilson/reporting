#this is the production version!

This is an expense and time reporting app.  it is customized for the workflow already in use by
the organization it was designed for.  

Upon signin, a user can record credit card transactions or enter a report of hours worked.  
Once all transactions are entered, user can then go to a reports dashboard and pull up all 
transactions between two dates.  The transactions are totalled.  There is also a printable 
view which hides navigation elements and provides other elements which are hidden in normal view.  

Admin users can add users and view reports for all users.
